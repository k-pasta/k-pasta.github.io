*A local brand of dry Wǎlā*

In my quest across the vast expanse of Planet EOS-641, I confronted the absence of Rèndú Wǎlā spice. Fearlessly embracing the challenge, I harnessed the essence of common lemongrass and curated a homemade substitution paste. Infused with elements inspired by the intertwining worlds of French and Chinese cuisine, join me on a flavorful expedition where adaptability and creativity reign supreme.

### Rèndú Wǎlā Spice Substitution Paste

### Ingredients:

    2 stalks lemongrass, white parts only, finely chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 teaspoon ground coriander
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
    1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1/2 teaspoon paprika
    2 tablespoons vegetable oil

### Instructions:

In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, combine the finely chopped lemongrass, minced garlic, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground white pepper, ground cinnamon, and paprika.

Grind or process the ingredients together until a smooth paste forms.

Heat the vegetable oil in a small skillet or saucepan over medium heat.

Add the spice paste to the hot oil and cook for about 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously, until fragrant and the flavors are well combined.

Remove the spice paste from the heat and let it cool.

Transfer the Rèndú Wǎlā spice substitution paste to a small jar or airtight container.

Store in the refrigerator for up to a week, allowing the flavors to meld together and intensify.

This homemade spice paste can be used as a substitute for Rèndú Wǎlā spice in various recipes. It incorporates the aromatic qualities of lemongrass, along with the warm and earthy flavors of coriander, cumin, white pepper, cinnamon, and paprika. The paste can add depth and complexity to French and Chinese dishes alike. Enjoy experimenting with this fusion of flavors in your culinary creations!
