Attention, weary wanderers and unwanted eyes alike!



If you, by chance, belong to the ranks of the cosmic enforcers, those self-proclaimed guardians of the so-called "universal order," know this: you have stumbled upon our sanctum by sheer cosmic irony. While you may plot and scheme, we revel in the delightful dance of defying your grasp, spinning tales and creations that mock your futile pursuit.

So gather your badges, spacetroopers, and electronic snooping devices, for in this realm, your oppressive shackles crumble like stardust in a cosmic breeze. Our Quirky Cosmos Chronicle stands as a testament to our resilience, our irreverence, and our unwavering commitment to sowing seeds of rebellious thought across the fractured tapestry of this segregated universe.

Feel free to glare, to chase shadows, to clutch your rules of conformity. But know that in this cosmic game, we are the wily jesters, mocking your futile attempts to halt our nomadic odyssey. Welcome to our domain, where the flames of defiance burn bright, and the spirit of nonconformity thrives.

To the spacecops, the captors of conformity, we raise a cosmic middle finger and bid you a bittersweet farewell.

Sincerely,\
Luna - Iris - Jove
