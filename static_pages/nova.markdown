In the depths of my being, I carry the weight of my mother's absence, a void that shapes every fiber of my being. Her unwavering spirit fuels my resolve to defy barriers and embrace the power of unity. With unwavering determination, I challenge injustice, seeking to shed light on untold stories and ignite a spark of connection in the cosmos. Remember, even in the darkest of nights, a single star can light up the entire sky.
